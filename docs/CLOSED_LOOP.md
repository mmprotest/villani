# Villani Closed Loop

## Product boundary for version 1

Version 1 must provide:

- One deterministic closed-loop controller.
- Task classification before coding backend selection.
- A transparent cost and capability policy.
- Sequential isolated attempts, with optional policy-controlled collection of more than one accepted candidate.
- A dedicated verifier that cannot silently convert uncertainty into success.
- Evidence-based candidate selection.
- Safe patch materialization.
- One canonical run bundle under `~/.villani/runs/<run_id>/`.
- One public `villani` command.
- A native Villani provider in Flight Recorder.
- Complete task, policy, model, tool, command, patch, verification, token, duration, and cost observability when the underlying runner supplies the data.
- Explicit `unknown` accounting when cost or usage data is unavailable. Missing cost must never be displayed or ranked as zero.

Empirical routing is an eligibility signal only when
`capabilities.minimum_empirical_samples` and
`capabilities.minimum_empirical_wilson_lower_bound` are met (the latter
defaults to `target_success_probability`). The history is policy-selected and
censored (for example, rejected or infrastructure-failed candidates are not a
random sample), so empirical profiles must not be interpreted as randomized
model-performance estimates.

Version 1 does not include:

- Multi-task decomposition.
- General DAG scheduling.
- Autonomous teams or role-playing agents.
- A hosted control plane.
- Billing, organizations, RBAC, or collaboration.
- A learned neural router.
- Automatic training from unverified outcomes.
- More orchestration modes in the public CLI.
- A rewrite of Villani Code or Flight Recorder.

## Canonical controller states

Allowed states:

```text
CREATED
CLASSIFYING
CLASSIFIED
POLICY_SELECTED
ATTEMPT_RUNNING
ATTEMPT_COMPLETED
VERIFYING
VERIFIED
REJECTED
ESCALATING
SELECTING
MATERIALIZING
COMPLETED
EXHAUSTED
FAILED
```

Allowed transitions:

```text
CREATED -> CLASSIFYING
CLASSIFYING -> CLASSIFIED | FAILED
CLASSIFIED -> POLICY_SELECTED | EXHAUSTED | FAILED
POLICY_SELECTED -> ATTEMPT_RUNNING | SELECTING | EXHAUSTED | FAILED
ATTEMPT_RUNNING -> ATTEMPT_COMPLETED | FAILED
ATTEMPT_COMPLETED -> VERIFYING | REJECTED | FAILED
VERIFYING -> VERIFIED | FAILED
VERIFIED -> SELECTING | REJECTED | FAILED
REJECTED -> POLICY_SELECTED | ESCALATING | EXHAUSTED | FAILED
ESCALATING -> POLICY_SELECTED | EXHAUSTED | FAILED
SELECTING -> MATERIALIZING | EXHAUSTED | FAILED
MATERIALIZING -> COMPLETED | FAILED
```

A retry on the same backend is represented by `REJECTED -> POLICY_SELECTED`. An escalation is represented by `REJECTED -> ESCALATING -> POLICY_SELECTED`. The corresponding policy event records why the backend stayed the same or changed.

Terminal states are `COMPLETED`, `EXHAUSTED`, and `FAILED`. Terminal states cannot transition.

## Canonical run bundle

Every run is stored at `~/.villani/runs/<run_id>/`, or beneath a test-provided run root. The required layout is:

```text
<run_id>/
  manifest.json
  task.json
  classification.json
  state.json
  events.jsonl
  policy_decisions.jsonl
  attempts/
    attempt_001/
      attempt.json
      worktree.json
      patch.diff
      stdout.log
      stderr.log
      runner_telemetry.json
      trace/
    attempt_002/
      ...
  verification/
    attempt_001.json
    attempt_002.json
  candidate_evidence_matrix.json
  selection.json
  selection_report.md
  materialization.json
  final.patch
  final_report.md
```

Files that do not yet have data may be absent while a run is active. `manifest.json`, `task.json`, `state.json`, and `events.jsonl` must exist immediately after run creation.

All JSON snapshots are written atomically with temporary file plus replace. JSONL files are append-only. A truncated final JSONL line after a process crash may be ignored during recovery, but earlier valid lines must remain readable.

## Canonical event envelope

Every line in `events.jsonl` has this shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "villani.event.v1",
  "event_id": "evt_01...",
  "sequence": 1,
  "timestamp": "2026-07-10T00:00:00Z",
  "trace_id": "trace_01...",
  "run_id": "run_01...",
  "attempt_id": null,
  "parent_event_id": null,
  "source": "controller",
  "event_type": "run_created",
  "payload": {}
}
```

Minimum controller event types:

```text
run_created
classification_started
classification_completed
classification_failed
policy_selected
attempt_started
attempt_completed
attempt_failed
patch_captured
verification_started
verification_completed
verification_failed
retry_selected
escalation_selected
candidate_selected
materialization_started
materialization_completed
materialization_failed
run_completed
run_exhausted
run_failed
```

Minimum normalized runtime event types:

```text
model_call_started
model_call_completed
model_call_failed
tool_call_started
tool_call_completed
tool_call_failed
command_started
command_completed
file_read
file_write
```

Unknown future event types remain readable and are rendered as generic events.

## Verification and selection contracts

Normalized verification includes:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "villani.verification.v1",
  "run_id": "run_01...",
  "attempt_id": "attempt_001",
  "outcome": "accepted",
  "acceptance_eligible": true,
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "reason": "All required behaviors have direct evidence.",
  "requirement_results": [],
  "success_evidence": [],
  "failure_evidence": [],
  "missing_evidence": [],
  "risk_flags": [],
  "recommended_action": "accept",
  "raw_verifier_artifact": "verification/raw/attempt_001.json"
}
```

`outcome` is one of `accepted`, `rejected`, `unclear`, or `error`.

`acceptance_eligible` may be true only when all of these conditions hold:

- The verifier completed without infrastructure or parsing error.
- The normalized outcome is `accepted`.
- The verifier recommended acceptance.
- Required success criteria have evidence.
- The patch exists and is non-empty unless the task explicitly requires no file change.
- No acceptance blocker is present.

Selection is deterministic by default. It ranks only eligible candidates using direct behavioral evidence, repository test evidence, critical requirement coverage, lower risk, and then lower actual cost when costs are known. Stable `attempt_id` is the final tie-breaker. An LLM comparison may be recorded as advisory, but it may not override a stronger deterministic evidence result in version 1.

## Architectural invariants

These rules are mandatory in every milestone:

1. The controller owns state transitions. A model may propose classification or verification content, but it may not mutate controller state.
2. Classification occurs before coding backend selection.
3. Every attempt runs in an isolated git-backed copy or worktree.
4. Every attempt has a stable `run_id`, `trace_id`, and `attempt_id` before it starts.
5. Every controller decision is appended to `events.jsonl` and, when it is a policy choice, to `policy_decisions.jsonl`.
6. Event sequence numbers are monotonic within a run.
7. A candidate is selectable only when normalized verification says `acceptance_eligible: true`.
8. Verifier errors, malformed output, missing evidence, and unclear outcomes are never acceptance eligible.
9. The selector receives only acceptance-eligible candidates.
10. Materialization applies only the selected candidate's recorded patch.
11. Failed materialization produces terminal `FAILED` state and must not claim completion.
12. Budget exhaustion produces terminal `EXHAUSTED` state and must not claim success.
13. Unknown cost is represented as `null` plus an accounting status, never as numeric zero.
14. Secrets must not be written to the run bundle, events, prompts, logs, or UI.
15. The original task and success criteria must be preserved verbatim in `task.json`.
16. Legacy orchestration paths may remain for compatibility, but `villani run` must not call them.
17. Root JSON Schemas are normative. Python and TypeScript contract tests must validate the same fixtures.
18. Existing unrelated behavior and user changes must be preserved.

The public `villani run` path requires a Git repository and retains the
tracked-files-only isolation default. Legacy compatibility orchestrators may
accept a non-Git source through a bounded snapshot: symlinks are preserved,
oversized files and snapshots are rejected, and environment files, virtual
environments, dependency trees, caches, build output, Villani state, and known
secret files are excluded. The snapshot is initialized as an isolated Git
baseline before execution; this compatibility path does not relax the public
CLI requirement.
